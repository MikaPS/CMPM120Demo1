*Key requiremnts for the assignment:*

    - First scene: introduction with a rocket flying off the right side of the screen. <br>
    - Second scene: video of fire turning off and a display of game company logo. <br>
    - Third scene: game menu with a moon picture and name of game (rocket). <br>
    - Fourth scene: star transition into beginning of the game. <br>
- **2+ audio assets**:<br>
    - Rocket launch: Sound Effect from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=music&amp;utm_content=76003">Pixabay</a>. I cut the 27 seconds video into a 3 seconds one using Clipchamp, a software that came with my laptop.<br>
    - Space background music: Sound Effect by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/samuelfrancisjohnson-1207793/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=music&amp;utm_content=106826">SamuelFrancisJohnson</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=music&amp;utm_content=106826">Pixabay</a>. Added a 1 second fade-in and half a second fade-out. Cut the audio down to 24 seconds, using Clipchamp, a software that came with my laptop.
- **2+ image assets**:<br>
    - Rocket picture: found from a website that has public domain pictures. https://clipartix.com/rocket-clipart-image-11846/. Changed the thickness of the window and added some lines at the top of the rocket using the mobile app ibisPaint X. Also, changed to transparent background using the website removebg.<br>
    - Fire image: Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/królestwo_nauki-17664295/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=6904983">Królestwo_Nauki</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=6904983">Pixabay</a>. Recolored the picture using the mobile app ibisPaint X. I created three versions of the drawing, each with different level of color (yellow, orange, red).  Also, changed to transparent background using the website removebg. <br>
    - Moon picture (I got the picture when I went to an observatory).<br>
    - Logo of game (cloudy games) - I created myself using the Canva website.<br>
- **2+ geometric shapes**:<br>
    Three rectangles at the first screen, star shapes in the fourth scene.<br>
- **1+ logotype**:<br>
    CloudyGames logo. Uses regular font, but instead of the letter 'o', there's a blue thinking bubble edited on Canva.<br>
- **1+ multi-line text**:<br>
    Used in the third scene, the options/quit text. Also, in last scene, displays the in-game text.<br>
- **1+ fading animation**:<br>
    Transition after the video (fade out) and into the game menu (fade in).<br>
- **1+ object motion animation**:<br>
    In the first scene, rocket and fires move to the right side of the screen. In the last scene, have 100+ stars moving from their original position to random positions off the screen.

    I created a black and white design on google slides, then added colors on mobile app ibisPaint X, and then added fade in effects between each picture using the mobile app iMovie.
